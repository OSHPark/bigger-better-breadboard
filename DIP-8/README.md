Irregularly Immense IC 
================================
A large breakout board for tiny chips

This is a breakout and protection board for DIP8 ICs. To encourage a wide variety of chips to be used, this board has a IO protection matrix on the bottom to help configure the chip's safety. Adjusting the pin matrix allows you to set the pin's usage mode between Power, Ground, Input, Output/IO, or Disconnected.
- Output/IO pins are then current limited using a resistor.
- Power and Ground pins are reverse polarity protected, and provided with bypass capacitors for stable operation of the IC. 
- Input pins are connected straight to the chip. 
- Disconnected pins are electrically isolated, if you're into that sort of thing.
