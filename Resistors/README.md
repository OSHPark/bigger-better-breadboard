Reasonably Requisite Resistor 
================================
Larger than expected impedences

Since resistors are critical to any circuit, they come in several flavors and sizes. These can be used
to reduce cost (boards can be expensive), or simply to help indicate magnitudes of resistance. 

The Varistor is a large, sliding potentiometer. This makes it simpler to view the effect of current in 
circuits, build resistor dividers, and trim potentiometers.

As a bonus, the white silkscreen can be painted using Sharpies to indicate standard color codes, 
and a spot is provided to write the value.
