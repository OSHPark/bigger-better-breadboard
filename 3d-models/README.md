3D Models
=========


These models were generated in AutoDesk Inventor, with the idea that all the 
components would have a full, 3D printed casing. The STL files are provided to simplify printing.

LED
---
This forms the cap for a very large and heavy LED. This helps with making the parts seem 
properly 10 times the normal ones, and diffuse the light. This model fits with the LED PCB, 
which provides a base and place to mount the leads. 


Resistor
--------
These parts were created, but subsequently abandoned due to cost and timeline, and assembly concerns. 
However, since it may prove useful to others, it's published anyway.


Known Issues
------------
- Due to an error in exporting, some of these are larger than expected by a factgor of 2.54.
- Resistor boards are entirely untested, and were never printed. They also don't match the resistor boards.
- The shell probably needs to be a bit thinner, as these are very heavy.
